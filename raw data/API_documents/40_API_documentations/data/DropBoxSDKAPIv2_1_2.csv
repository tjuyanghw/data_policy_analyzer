com.dropbox.core.ServerException,"The server said that something went wrong on its end (HTTP 500 error code).
 This indicates bug on the Dropbox server, but there are multiple potential causes.

 
 Sometimes it's just a bug and there's nothing you can
     do about it until its fixed.  Report it on the Dropbox API forums.
     
 Sometimes you're actually making an invalid request, but for some reason
     the server's validation logic isn't catching the problem and it's
     causing the server to error-out somewhere down the line.  You may be able to
     fix your request and get things working.  This is still a bug on Dropbox's end,
     so you should still report it on the Dropbox API forums.
 Sometimes the error is intermittent.  It may only happen once every few
     requests, in which case you can temporarily work around the issue by
     retrying the request.  Again, this still counts as a bug so report it on
     the forums.
 Sometimes the error is temporary.  For example, Dropbox might be experiencing
     a temporary network or hardware issue.  If you wait a few minutes, the error
     might stop happening.  You might want to check the forums to see if other
     people are seeing the same thing.
