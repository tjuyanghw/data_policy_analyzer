Upon the initialization of AndroidXMapFragment, a Map object is automatically created and bound to the fragment. This Map object is then persisted throughout the AndroidXMapFragment's lifetime. Since AndroidXMapFragment internally calls Fragment.setRetainInstance(true), the Map will retain any properties applied to it during an application's lifetime.   AndroidXMapFragment objects have their own lifecycle, state, and back stack, thus it is unsafe to assume objects returned by a AndroidXMapFragment instance (with the exception of Map) will be available throughout the lifetime of its attached activity.

com.here.android.mpa.customlocation2.CLE2Task,"Encapsulates an asynchronous CLE2 task (that usually involves network communication and/or database operations) and provides some common operations like observing, waiting for the result, cancelling or getting the result.  A typical use for a CLE2Task involves creating a task, subscribing to it and starting its execution. The factory methods usually looks something like newActionTask(parameters) where Action is a descriptive name of what the task will do. For example, if you don't care about holding onto the task for later use or having more than one subscriber, you might write CLE2DataManager.getInstance().newListLayersTask(StorageType.LOCAL).start(myListener) to create and start a task that will get the list of locally stored layers.   CLE2Task also provides some more advanced features. For example, if you are performing a background operation that involves interacting with CLE2, a CLE2Task can be used in a synchronous manner by means of calling CLE2Task.waitForResult() method and then getting the result and error from the the finished task.  Having multiple subscribers to the task is also possible.

After that, you can customize the settings of VenueService and start the VenueService by calling VenueMapView.startVenueServiceAsync(VenueService.VenueServiceListener). To enable interactive use an instance of VenueMapLayer, add listeners for relevant events to the it as shown in the example below.   VenueMapView m_mapView;
 Map          m_map;

 public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
     // ...other initializations...
     m_mapView = (VenueMapView) findViewById(R.id.mapcanvas);
     MapEngine.getInstance().init(this, m_listener);
     // ... other initializations...
 }

     // ...other initializations...
     m_map = new Map();
     m_mapView.setMap(m_map);
     m_mapView.initialize(m_activity);
     // ...customize VenueService settings...
     m_mapView.startVenueServiceAsync(m_venueServiceListener);
     // ...other initializations...
 }

 private VenueServiceListener m_venueServiceListener = new VenueServiceListener() {",startVenueServiceAsync(VenueService.VenueServiceListener serviceListener),Asynchronously initialize and starts the VenueService object.,void
