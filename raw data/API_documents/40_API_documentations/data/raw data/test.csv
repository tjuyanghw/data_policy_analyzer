com.facebook.GraphRequest," A single request to be sent to the Facebook Platform through the Graph API. The Request class provides functionality relating to serializing and deserializing requests and responses, making calls in batches (with a single round-trip to the service) and making calls asynchronously.  The particular service endpoint that a request targets is determined by a graph path (see the setGraphPath method).  A Request can be executed either anonymously or representing an authenticated user. In the former case, no AccessToken needs to be specified, while in the latter, an AccessToken must be provided. If requests are executed in a batch, a Facebook application ID must be associated with the batch, either by setting the application ID in the AndroidManifest.xml or via FacebookSdk or by calling the setDefaultBatchApplicationId method.  After completion of a request, the AccessToken, if not null and taken from AccessTokenManager, will be checked to determine if its Facebook access token needs to be extended; if so, a request to extend it will be issued in the background. ",executeAndWait(),Executes this request on the current thread and blocks while waiting for the response.,GraphResponse
