com.here.android.mpa.mapping.AndroidXMapFragment,"A fragment class that automatically creates a Map and handles map UI interactions such as panning and zooming. AndroidXMapFragment extends the Android Fragment class and retains its lifecycle behaviors.  Upon the initialization of AndroidXMapFragment, a Map object is automatically created and bound to the fragment. This Map object is then persisted throughout the AndroidXMapFragment's lifetime. Since AndroidXMapFragment internally calls Fragment.setRetainInstance(true), the Map will retain any properties applied to it during an application's lifetime.   AndroidXMapFragment objects have their own lifecycle, state, and back stack, thus it is unsafe to assume objects returned by a AndroidXMapFragment instance (with the exception of Map) will be available throughout the lifetime of its attached activity.   A AndroidXMapFragment is defined in an Android layout XML file. For example:   
   <fragment
       class=""com.here.android.mpa.mapping.AndroidXMapFragment""
       android:id=""@+id/map_fragment""
       android:layout_width=""match_parent""
       android:layout_height=""match_parent""/>
 
   Note: AndroidXMapFragment automatically handles MapEngine pausing and resuming during activity state changes, thus it is not necessary for the activity that owns AndroidXMapFragment instances to manually call MapEngine.onPause() or MapEngine.onResume() during the activity's AndroidXMapFragment.onPause() and AndroidXMapFragment.onResume(). However, considerations should be made in how much processing is done during the onResume() method. Performing significant amounts of processing may delay view rendering in cases such as device orientation changes. In these cases, it is recommended to use a specifically designated handler to organize the amount of processing to be done.
