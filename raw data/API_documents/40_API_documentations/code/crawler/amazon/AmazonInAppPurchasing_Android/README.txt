Thank you for your interest in In-App Purchasing (IAP). 

We are continually improving our APIs and recently introduced IAP 2.0. 
We’ve replaced the PurchaseToken in IAP 1.0 with a unique ReceiptId in 2.0. This 
ReceiptId allows you to track fulfillment status and convey status to Amazon, 
identify duplicate transactions to prevent over-fulfillment, receive notifications 
of transactions that were cancelled, and reconcile transaction records with your 
Amazon earnings report. Additionally, for apps with IAP 2.0, we’ve replaced 
SDKTester with App Tester for testing purposes. Please use IAP 2.0 for any new 
builds and updates. We’ve provided full documentation at 
https://developer.amazon.com/public/apis/earn/in-app-purchasing. 

If you have IAP 1.0 within your current app, we strongly suggest upgrading your 
app to IAP 2.0 and have included a migration document as part of our API 
documentation referenced earlier. If you need to reference IAP 1.0, please go to 
https://developer.amazon.com/public/apis/earn/in-app-purchasing/in-app-purchasing-v1.

Thanks,
